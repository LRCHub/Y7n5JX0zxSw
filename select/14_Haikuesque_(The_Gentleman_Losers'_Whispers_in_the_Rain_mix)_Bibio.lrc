[00:48.27] When she laughs
[00:51.55] The piano in the hall
[00:53.96] Plays a quiet note
[01:02.96] 
[00:59.90] Waterfalls
[01:03.07] Turning gentle into rough
[01:05.63] Then gentle again
[01:14.13] 
[01:11.40] Morning dew
[01:14.08] Washes yesterday's garden
[01:17.15] Ready for today
[01:24.65] 
[01:22.72] Rocking chair
[01:25.40] Is still without a rocker
[01:28.55] But is still a chair
[01:38.55] 
[02:08.71] When she laughs
[02:22.67] The piano in the hall
[02:36.11] Resonates a note.
