It's on the end for the limit its subscription on the policy payroll
I hate the word the thought of it is just enough to make me go AWOL
I'm just too young to belong to anyone and I'm too old to be taken
So when you sign up remember what they said about the one you're displacing

(Chorus)
Wake up and come down slow
I'll see you when your eyes come open soon
The answer ain't long, they may sign on
But all they really wanted is to be home

Now they pull me over and ask me things about you I can barely remember
I guess he lost his mind, let it wander to the ocean then it never recovered
They were my girls, my friends, my future plans
I don't see how this could happen
So when you drive home my loneliness is gonna be the distance behind you

(Chorus)
Wake up and come down slow
I'll see you when your eyes come open soon
The answer ain't long, they may sign on
But all they really wanted is to be home

When they can and relief is gonna feel just like the pictures up on the wall
I don't believe it even comes close, but that's the way it falls
