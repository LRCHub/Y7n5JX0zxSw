Tears
I am the last living gentleman, ahh
NOVAGANG

I'm a gentleman
Take my gentle hand
Off to a gentle land
I'm a gentleman
I am

Up top
Bow down
Rock it to the side when you tip that crown
Fedora real tight, slow down
Pinky up high, it ain't never comin' down, no

I'm a gentleman
Take my gentle hand
Off to a gentle land
I'm a gentleman
I'm a gentleman
Take my gentle hand
Off to a gentle land
I'm a gentleman

Check!
G-G-Guess who came, I don't miss
Break that wrist, can't do it likе this
Shoot my shot, won't miss
Nice like that, you gotta admit
O-o-oh my god, he lightning rod
Piping hot with mic and ball
Writе in and out, you got it, little eyes
Throwback line, man, I go hard
Oh my
The winning verse open up like it got good manners
I'mma just put it on the floor
Will let you know like I got all the answers
No questions, I'mma make sure no stressin'
Keep it interestin'
Taking wrong steps in the right direction
No flexin' (flexin', flexin', flexin', flexin')

I'm a gentleman
Take my gentle hand
Off to a gentle land
I'm a gentleman
I'm a gentleman
Take my gentle hand
Off to a gentle land
I'm a gentleman
I am
